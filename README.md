# FREESTAND 
___


I've been using C for the last year and a half, and as my understanding deepens, I've come across [null program](https://nullprogram.com/) website, and I sart reading about freestanding executables.

I've also heard other professionals talking about such a thing, and while I am not even near these profesionals abilities, I want to write my own, functionalities to achieve the same result.
